# To-Folks-Looking-At-My-Github

Why isn't their much on my github? Three reasons:

1. Past smaller projects are under an NDA. I can't legally share it.
2. I'm currently a freelance full-stack developer. I unfortunately don't post my clients' software (or code for my personal startups) publicly -- especially since they contain sensitive information.
3. I'm an author. As in, I've been writing books since I was 5 years old and I spend the vast majority of my free time working on those.

I'm a multipoteltialite. I'm cursed to like a lot of things. Yes, I know as a developer I should be active on github, contributing to open source projects, and so on. Yes, I know as a writer, I should be actively trying to build my mailing list and maintaining a blog. I appologize I'm apparently not "serious" or "passionate" about what I do because I don't do those things. I genuinely wish I had time for it. I hate using this as an excuse. But there are only 24-hours in a day.

If you want to see code I've written, schedule a screen share interview with me. I'll show you.
